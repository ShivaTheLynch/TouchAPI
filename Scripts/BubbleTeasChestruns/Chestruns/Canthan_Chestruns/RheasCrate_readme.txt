This readme contains some Description for the Use of this bot :)

This bot is a Chestrunning - Bot in Factions. It runs in HM to get Outcast Shields - Elite Tomes
It starts at Seafarer's Rest and runs in Rheas Crate.
The Area contains 0-1 Chests per run. It is a very short run.
Stuff you need to have:
You need to have more points of the opposing faction which holds Seafarer's Rest.
For Example: Right now, Seafarer's Rest is in the Hands of the Kurzick. So you need to have more Luxon points then Kurzick Points
(Not Title Points - just the points you get while Vanquishing)
