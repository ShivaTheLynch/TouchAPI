This readme contains some Description for the Use of this bot :)

This bot is a Chestrunning - Bot in Factions. It runs in HM to get q9 Shields, Swords, from Tut Island (Sunqua Blades - Ayes and stuff)
It starts at Minister Cho's Estate and runs in Sunqua Vale.
The Area contains 0-2 Chests per run. It is a very short run.
You will not cast any running skills until you find a Chest -> ist faster this way, so bring Heroes with "Incoming"
